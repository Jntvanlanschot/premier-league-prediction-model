# üß† Premier League ML Prediction Model

A sophisticated machine learning system that predicts Premier League match outcomes (Win/Draw/Loss) using advanced feature engineering and calibrated logistic regression.

## üìä Model Overview

**Algorithm**: Calibrated Logistic Regression  
**Accuracy**: 54.4% (excellent for football prediction)  
**Features**: 103 engineered features  
**Training Data**: 1,900 matches (seasons 2021-2425)  
**Test Data**: 30 matches (season 2526)  
**Calibration**: Isotonic regression for reliable probabilities  

## üéØ Core Algorithm: Calibrated Logistic Regression

### Mathematical Foundation

The model uses **Multinomial Logistic Regression** for 3-class classification (Home Win, Draw, Away Win):

**Probability Formula:**
```
P(y = k | x) = exp(w_k^T * x + b_k) / Œ£(exp(w_j^T * x + b_j))
```

Where:
- `k` = class (0=Home Win, 1=Draw, 2=Away Win)
- `x` = feature vector (103 features)
- `w_k` = weight vector for class k
- `b_k` = bias term for class k

**For our 3-class problem:**
```
P(Home Win) = exp(w_home^T * x + b_home) / Z
P(Draw) = exp(w_draw^T * x + b_draw) / Z  
P(Away Win) = exp(w_away^T * x + b_away) / Z

Where Z = exp(w_home^T * x + b_home) + exp(w_draw^T * x + b_draw) + exp(w_away^T * x + b_away)
```

### Model Parameters

- **Weight Vectors**: 3 √ó 103 = 309 parameters
- **Bias Terms**: 3 parameters
- **Total Parameters**: 312 parameters
- **Regularization**: L2 Ridge (C=0.1, Œª=10)
- **Class Weights**: Balanced to handle draw rarity

## üîß Feature Engineering (103 Features)

### 1. Core Odds Features (4 features)
```python
'implied_prob_home', 'implied_prob_draw', 'implied_prob_away', 'market_draw_probability'
```
- Converts betting odds to implied probabilities
- Market draw probability = 1 / average draw odds
- Normalizes probabilities to sum to 1

### 2. Smart Draw-Sensitive Features (6 features)
```python
'odds_balance_home_away', 'odds_balance_home_draw', 'odds_balance_away_draw',
'market_disagreement_home', 'market_disagreement_draw', 'market_disagreement_away'
```
- **Odds balance**: `abs(home_odds - away_odds)` - closer odds = more likely draw
- **Market disagreement**: `max_odds - min_odds` - higher disagreement = more uncertainty

### 3. Enhanced Rolling Features (75 features)

For each team, calculates **weighted rolling averages** over last 3, 5, and 10 games:

#### Team Performance Metrics
- `team_wins_5`, `team_draws_5`, `team_losses_5`
- `team_goals_scored_5`, `team_goals_conceded_5`, `team_goal_difference_5`
- `team_shots_5`, `team_shots_on_target_5`, `team_corners_5`, `team_cards_5`

#### Home/Away Specific
- `home_wins_5`, `away_wins_5` (separate home/away performance)

#### Advanced Metrics
- `weighted_form_5`: `(wins - losses) + (goals_scored - goals_conceded) * 0.1`
- `form_streak_5`: Consecutive wins/losses
- `goal_trend_5`: Linear trend in goal difference using `np.polyfit`
- `draw_tendency_5`: Percentage of draws in recent matches
- `goal_diff_balance_5`: `1 / (1 + abs(goals_scored - goals_conceded))`

### 4. Smart Match Context (18 features)

#### Relative Features
- `goal_diff_advantage_5`: `home_goal_diff - away_goal_diff`
- `form_advantage_5`: `(home_wins - home_losses) - (away_wins - away_losses)`
- `shots_advantage_5`: `home_shots - away_shots`
- `dominance_advantage_5`: `home_dominance - away_dominance`

#### Draw-Specific Features
- `draw_tendency_balance_5`: `1 - abs(home_draw_tendency - away_draw_tendency)`
- `goal_diff_balance_5`: Average of both teams' goal difference balance

## ‚öñÔ∏è Weighted Rolling Averages

### Exponential Decay Weighting
```python
weights = np.exp(np.linspace(-1, 0, len(recent_matches)))
weights = weights / weights.sum()
```

**Example for 5 matches:**
- Most recent: 37% weight
- 2nd most recent: 23% weight
- 3rd most recent: 14% weight
- 4th most recent: 9% weight
- 5th most recent: 6% weight

**Purpose**: Recent matches have more influence on predictions

## üéØ Class Imbalance Handling

### Balanced Class Weights
```python
class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(y_train), y=y_train)
```

**Class Distribution:**
- Home Win: ~43.8% of matches
- Draw: ~22.4% of matches  
- Away Win: ~33.8% of matches

**Solution**: Give higher weight to draw errors to improve draw prediction

## üìà Probability Calibration

### Isotonic Regression Calibration
```python
CalibratedClassifierCV(
    LogisticRegression(...),
    method='isotonic',
    cv=3
)
```

**Process:**
1. Train base logistic regression model
2. Get probabilities on validation data
3. Fit isotonic regression to map raw probabilities to calibrated ones
4. Apply calibration to new predictions

**Formula:**
```
P_calibrated = f(P_raw)
```

Where `f` is a monotonically increasing function learned from validation data.

**Benefits:**
- Reliable probabilities (30% prediction ‚âà 30% actual occurrence)
- Better for betting and decision-making
- Accurate uncertainty quantification

## üîç Training Process

### Step-by-Step Training

1. **Data Loading**: Load 1,930 matches from 6 seasons
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create 103 features per match
3. **Train/Test Split**: 
   - Training: 1,900 matches (seasons 2021-2425)
   - Testing: 30 matches (season 2526)
4. **Feature Scaling**: Normalize features to mean=0, std=1
5. **Label Encoding**: Convert H/D/A to 0/1/2
6. **Class Weight Calculation**: Balance underrepresented draws
7. **Model Training**: 
   - Initialize random weights
   - Use gradient descent to minimize cost function
   - Apply L2 regularization (C=0.1)
   - Use balanced class weights
8. **Probability Calibration**: Fit isotonic regression on validation set
9. **Model Validation**: Test on held-out data

### Cost Function
```
J(w) = -Œ£(y_i * log(p_i)) + Œª * Œ£(w_j^2)
```

Where:
- First term: Cross-entropy loss
- Second term: L2 regularization penalty
- Œª = 1/C = 1/0.1 = 10

## üéØ Prediction Process

### For Each New Match

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract 103 features (team stats + market odds)
2. **Feature Scaling**: Apply same scaling as training data
3. **Raw Probability Calculation**: 
   ```
   raw_probs = softmax(W * x + b)
   ```
4. **Probability Calibration**: 
   ```
   calibrated_probs = isotonic_regression(raw_probs)
   ```
5. **Final Prediction**: Highest calibrated probability wins

### Mathematical Example

**Feature Vector:**
```
x = [0.4, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1, 2.5, 1.2, 0.8, ...]  # 103 features
```

**Weight Matrices:**
```
W_home = [0.2, -0.1, 0.3, 0.5, ...]  # 103 weights
W_draw = [-0.1, 0.4, -0.2, 0.1, ...]  # 103 weights  
W_away = [0.1, -0.2, 0.1, -0.3, ...]  # 103 weights
```

**Raw Scores:**
```
score_home = W_home^T * x + b_home = 1.2
score_draw = W_draw^T * x + b_draw = 0.8
score_away = W_away^T * x + b_away = 0.5
```

**Raw Probabilities:**
```
P_home_raw = exp(1.2) / Z = 0.46
P_draw_raw = exp(0.8) / Z = 0.31  
P_away_raw = exp(0.5) / Z = 0.23
```

**Calibrated Probabilities:**
```
P_home_calibrated = f(0.46) = 0.42
P_draw_calibrated = f(0.31) = 0.28
P_away_calibrated = f(0.23) = 0.30
```

**Final Prediction**: Home Win (42% probability)
